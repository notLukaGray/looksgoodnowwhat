This is a book about the gap between good creative and real strategy. It's about the difference between work that looks polished and work that can actually stand up to context, critique, and business needs.

<div style="height: 30px;"></div>

This isn't about how to design. It's about understanding what makes the design matter. What makes it coherent. What makes it defensible. Most importantly, what makes it make sense.

You already know how to build things. You've got taste, training, and tools. But at some point, someone is going to ask why. Why this idea. Why this form. Why now. And if the only answer is "it feels right," that won't be enough.

<div style="height: 30px;"></div>

This is a book about building that answer. It's for designers who want their work to carry weight. Less about best practices, more about clear thinking. Less about templates, more about how to ask better questions before the work begins.

**If the idea falls apart when you speak it out loud, it was never strong enough to begin with.**
